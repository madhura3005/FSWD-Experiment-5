1. Setting up a Node.js Project
•	Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).
•	Initialize the project using npm init -y, which generates a package.json file.
•	Install Express with npm install express.

Conclusion:
In this experiment, we set up a basic Node.js server and created HTTP endpoints using Express.js. We learned how to handle different HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and process request data using middleware like express.json(). Express simplified routing and request handling, making server-side development more efficient. We also implemented error handling to improve server reliability. This experiment provided a strong foundation for backend development, preparing us for building dynamic and scalable web applications.
